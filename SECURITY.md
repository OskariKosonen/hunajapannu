### Security Best Practices for Users

When deploying this application:

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
2. **Azure Access**: Use minimal required permissions for Azure Blob Storage
3. **Network Security**: Deploy behind a firewall/VPN for production use
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated regularly
6. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity

### Known Security Considerations

- This application processes SSH honeypot logs which may contain malicious content
- File uploads are limited to prevent DoS attacks
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Input validation is performed on all user inputs

### Security Features

- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for specific origins
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Memory Limits**: Prevents memory exhaustion attacks
- **Timeout Handling**: Prevents long-running operations
- **Error Handling**: Prevents information leakage

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not offer a formal bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge security researchers who help improve our security.
